Problem Description
There are N players each with strength A[i]. when player i attack player j, player j strength reduces to max(0, A[j]-A[i]). When a player's strength reaches zero, it loses the game and the game continues in the same manner among other players until only 1 survivor remains.

Can you tell the minimum health last surviving person can have?


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000000


Input Format
First and only argument of input contains a single integer array A.


Output Format
Return a single integer denoting minimum health of last person.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [6, 4]
Input 2:
 A = [2, 3, 4]

Example Output
Output 1:
 2
Output 2:
 1
