"""
Find nth Magic Number
Problem Description
Given an integer A, find and return the A'th magic number. A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5. First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.  


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 5000


Input Format
The only argument given is integer A.


Output Format
Return the Ath magic number.


Example Input
Example Input 1:
 A = 3
Example Input 2:
 A = 10
  


Example Output
Example Output 1:
 30
Example Output 2:
 650
  


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 A in increasing order is [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
 3rd element in this is 30

## Solution

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        binary = bin(A)[2:][::-1]
        magic_number = 0
        i = 1
        for ele in binary:
            if ele == "1":
                magic_number += 5**i
            i += 1
        return magic_number
